To complete this Packet Tracer IPv6 ACL configuration, follow these detailed steps:

# **üü¢ Part 1: Configure, Apply, and Verify IPv6 ACL to Block HTTP/HTTPS**
### **Scenario**
A DoS attack from the `2001:DB8:1:11::/64` network is targeting **Server3 (2001:DB8:1:30::30)** with excessive HTTP and HTTPS requests. We need to **block** this traffic while allowing all other traffic.

## **Step 1: Configure the IPv6 ACL on R1**
1. **Access R1 and enter configuration mode:**
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   ```

2. **Create the ACL named `BLOCK_HTTP` and block HTTP/HTTPS traffic from any source to Server3:**
   ```bash
   ipv6 access-list BLOCK_HTTP
   deny tcp any host 2001:DB8:1:30::30 eq www
   deny tcp any host 2001:DB8:1:30::30 eq 443
   permit ipv6 any any
   exit
   ```

---

## **Step 2: Apply the ACL to the Correct Interface**
1. Identify the **incoming interface** from the attacking network `2001:DB8:1:11::/64` on **R1**.  
   - Suppose the interface connected to this network is **GigabitEthernet0/0**.
   
2. **Apply the ACL to that interface in the inbound direction:**
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_HTTP in
   exit
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Verify the ACL Implementation**
### **Testing from PC1 (Not in 2001:DB8:1:11::/64)**
- Open a web browser and go to:
  ```
  http://2001:DB8:1:30::30
  https://2001:DB8:1:30::30
  ```
  ‚úÖ **Website should load successfully.**

### **Testing from PC2 (In 2001:DB8:1:11::/64)**
- Open a web browser and go to:
  ```
  http://2001:DB8:1:30::30
  https://2001:DB8:1:30::30
  ```
  ‚ùå **Website should be blocked.**

- **Ping Server3 from PC2:**
  ```bash
  ping 2001:DB8:1:30::30
  ```
  ‚úÖ **Ping should succeed (since only HTTP/HTTPS is blocked).**

---

# **üü¢ Part 2: Configure, Apply, and Verify IPv6 ACL to Block ICMP**
### **Scenario**
A **DDoS attack** is now targeting Server3 with excessive ICMP pings. To mitigate this, **all ICMP traffic** to Server3 must be blocked.

## **Step 1: Create an IPv6 ACL to Block ICMP on R3**
1. **Access R3 and enter configuration mode:**
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   ```

2. **Create the ACL named `BLOCK_ICMP` to block all ICMP traffic:**
   ```bash
   ipv6 access-list BLOCK_ICMP
   deny icmp any any
   permit ipv6 any any
   exit
   ```

---

## **Step 2: Apply the ACL to the Correct Interface**
- Since ICMP traffic **comes from multiple sources**, we apply this ACL **closest to the destination**, which is **R3's interface connected to Server3**.
  
1. Identify the correct interface on **R3**. Suppose it's **GigabitEthernet0/1**.
2. **Apply the ACL on that interface in the inbound direction:**
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_ICMP in
   exit
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Verify the ACL Implementation**
### **Testing from PC2**
1. **Ping Server3 from PC2:**
   ```bash
   ping 2001:DB8:1:30::30
   ```
   ‚ùå **Ping should fail.**

### **Testing from PC1**
1. **Ping Server3 from PC1:**
   ```bash
   ping 2001:DB8:1:30::30
   ```
   ‚ùå **Ping should fail.**

2. **Open a web browser and go to `http://2001:DB8:1:30::30` or `https://2001:DB8:1:30::30`:**
   ‚úÖ **Website should load successfully (since only ICMP is blocked).**

# **‚úÖ Summary of ACL Configurations**
### **üöÄ On R1 (Blocking HTTP/HTTPS from 2001:DB8:1:11::/64)**
```bash
ipv6 access-list BLOCK_HTTP
 deny tcp any host 2001:DB8:1:30::30 eq www
 deny tcp any host 2001:DB8:1:30::30 eq 443
 permit ipv6 any any
exit
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_HTTP in
exit
```

### **üöÄ On R3 (Blocking ICMP to Server3)**
```bash
ipv6 access-list BLOCK_ICMP
 deny icmp any any
 permit ipv6 any any
exit
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_ICMP in
exit
```

---

## **Final Verification**
- Run the following **show commands** on R1 and R3 to confirm ACL hits:
  ```bash
  show ipv6 access-list
  ```
  - This will display ACL rules and the number of **matches (hits)**.

  ```bash
  show running-config | section ipv6
  ```
  - This will confirm that ACLs are applied correctly.

---

# **üéØ Next Steps**
1. **Check your Packet Tracer Assessment Results**  
2. If any ACL is still marked incorrect, let me know what error you see, and I‚Äôll debug it for you! üöÄ

Your assessment shows that the ACLs **BLOCK_HTTP** and **BLOCK_ICMP** are correct, but the **IPv6 Traffic Filter In on R1 (GigabitEthernet0/1)** and **IPv6 Traffic Filter Out on R3 (GigabitEthernet0/0)** are incorrect.

---

## **üîç Fixing IPv6 Traffic Filter on R1 and R3**

### **üõ† Issue 1: R1 (GigabitEthernet0/1) - Incorrect IPv6 Traffic Filter In**
- **Why?**  
  - The ACL **BLOCK_HTTP** is correct, but it might be applied to the **wrong interface**.
  - You likely applied it on **GigabitEthernet0/0**, but Packet Tracer expects it on **GigabitEthernet0/1**.

- **Fix:**
  1. Remove ACL from the wrong interface (if applied elsewhere):  
     ```bash
     configure terminal
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     no ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_HTTP in
     exit
     ```
  2. Apply ACL to **GigabitEthernet0/1** instead:
     ```bash
     interface GigabitEthernet0/1
     ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_HTTP in
     exit
     ```

---

### **üõ† Issue 2: R3 (GigabitEthernet0/0) - Incorrect IPv6 Traffic Filter Out**
- **Why?**  
  - The **BLOCK_ICMP** ACL is correct, but Packet Tracer expects it in the **Inbound direction**, not Outbound.

- **Fix:**
  1. Remove the ACL applied in the Outbound direction:
     ```bash
     configure terminal
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     no ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_ICMP out
     exit
     ```
  2. Apply ACL **Inbound** instead:
     ```bash
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_ICMP in
     exit
     ```

---

### **üìå Final Verification**
After applying these fixes, use:
```bash
show ipv6 access-list
show running-config | section ipv6
```
- Ensure ACLs are now applied to the correct **interfaces** and **directions**.

---

### **üéØ Summary of Fixes**
| Device | Interface | ACL | Direction | Fix |
|--------|----------|-----|-----------|-----|
| R1 | GigabitEthernet0/1 | BLOCK_HTTP | INBOUND | ‚úÖ Apply here |
| R3 | GigabitEthernet0/0 | BLOCK_ICMP | INBOUND | ‚úÖ Apply here |

üîÑ **Recheck Packet Tracer Assessment** ‚Äì It should now show **Correct** for all sections! üöÄ

Your remaining issue is **"IPv6 Traffic Filter Out Incorrect"** on **GigabitEthernet0/0** of **R3**.

---

## **üõ† Fixing IPv6 Traffic Filter Out Issue on R3**
### **‚úÖ Solution**
The **BLOCK_ICMP** ACL is correctly configured, but it is applied **outbound** when it should be applied **inbound**.

1. **Remove incorrect outbound application:**
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   no ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_ICMP out
   exit
   ```
   
2. **Apply the ACL inbound instead:**
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   ipv6 traffic-filter BLOCK_ICMP in
   exit
   ```

---

## **üìå Verify Fix**
After applying the fix, check with:
```bash
show ipv6 interface GigabitEthernet0/0
show ipv6 access-list
show running-config | section ipv6
```
Ensure that **BLOCK_ICMP** is now applied as **Inbound**.

---

### **üéØ Summary of Fix**
| Device | Interface | ACL | Correct Direction | Fix |
|--------|----------|-----|--------------------|-----|
| R3 | GigabitEthernet0/0 | BLOCK_ICMP | **INBOUND** | ‚úÖ Apply inbound |

üîÑ **Recheck Packet Tracer Assessment** ‚Äì It should now be 100% correct! üöÄ
